# rodentcycles
Using a suite of mathematical models I investigate cycles in mice and voles
This manuscript is currently in prep for submission to a peer reviewed journal so R code is being tidied for that. Once it is finished I will reupload!

You will find some hopefully useful code here about timeseries and wavelet coherancy plots

Cheers!
